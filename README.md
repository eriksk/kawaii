# Kawaii <3

[Change log](https://github.com/eriksk/kawaii/blob/master/changelog.md)
[Feature list and development progress](https://github.com/eriksk/kawaii/blob/master/backlog.md)

## What is Kawaii?
Kawaii is a tiny game library for ruby built on top of gosu. It makes it quick and easy to create 2D games.

## How do I use it?
To create a basic kawaii game, just install the gem

	gem install kawaii

And then run the following command

	kawaii new mysuperawesomefirstgame

This will create a new basic game with a default resolution set to 800 x 600.

To change the configuration for the game simply edit the config.yml file that is created along with the game file. The config file itself is rather self-explanatory.

## Why does Kawaii exist?
I wanted a way of quickly prototyping games for iPhone and iPad without Objective-C. Being pretty comfy with Ruby, I thought, why not!? 

## Will this be distributed as a gem?
It is! Just run this command to install it!

	gem install kawaii

## What kind of features will it have?
A lot! Check out the full list of implemented & to be implemented features
