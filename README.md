# <3 Kawaii <3

## What is Kawaii?
Kawaii is a tiny game library for ruby built on top of gosu. It makes it quick and easy to create 2D games.

## How does it work?
It doesn't work yet... But it will, soon!

## Why doesn't it work yet?
Give me a break I started working on this 2012-06-27! Geez!

## Will this be distributed as a gem?
Yes, sooner or later.

## What kind of features will it have?
Aside from being totally cute (hence the name) it will have:
* Content management
	* Sharing sprites with nodes
	* Tiling made easy
* Node management, a tree of nodes can be easily created and managed.
* Menu system
* Input management
* Helper functions/math
* Lots of tweenings & other juicyness
* Tiled importer (<del>xml</del> & json)
	* Imports maps from Tiled and draws them
